# CSS Vocabulary

Deprecated by https://github.com/sakamies/vocabs

A small app to browse through which is what in css. Has some sample css with a list of css terminology. Clicking on anything in one panel highlights the corresponding items in the other.

My purpose is to follow the specifications closely, always preferring the most recent version of the specs. So some common terminology might be out of scope for the vocabulary list. (Like names of common tricks or techniques, or some such.)

Feedback, improvements and forks welcome.
